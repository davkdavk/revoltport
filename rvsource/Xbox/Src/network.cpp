MAYBE_KEEPERS:

* Session: dwMaxPlayers ?? (== DEFAULT_RACE_CARS)

* LocalPlayerData: Ready flag -- do we want it?  (If so, need to update it.)
  --> The 'Ready' flag only gets used in a couple places (SendGameLoaded, ProcessGameLoaded, CheckAllPlayersReady)
  --> I'm not even sure we need that flag; maybe assume that load will take same amount of time on all machines?  (And sync messages account for time diffs, right?)
  --> But if do use it, seems like might want per-machine, NOT per-player (b/c only used to tell when game is loaded, right?)

NON-KEEPER NOTES:

* Session: dwUser1 == bStarted
*/


/*

$CMP_NOTE:  Right now, we don't get PlayerList/PlayerCount until we join a session.  (So seeing list of players before joining session is not yet supported.  Maybe matchmaking will fix this for the non-system-link case.)

$BUG: don't really want PlayerID in the message header. Need a way to determine player w/o that...

$HEY: can we remove CarName globally, and just use CarType? (b/c user won't be creating arbitrary cars; we'll be telling them what cars are available) (but maybe an issue if user plays against someone with new car, which he hasn't downloaded yet, and which doesn't exist locally!?)

$TODO: remove, in all files, all XBOX_DISABLE_NETWORK #ifdef lines!!

$HEY: TotalDataSent isn't being updated (b/c calling winsock stuff directly, instead of going through SendMessage / SendMessageGuaranteed!)

$HEY: replace SendMessage**() calls with send/sendto !? (but they also update a TotalDataSent var in those funcs)
 --> So maybe update send/sendto call to use SendMessage** ??

$HEY - (Acclaim Aug99) here are some new fields in SessionList[] that get set in EnumSessionsCallback <what about elsewhere?>
(But note that SessionList is a static var, so at least effects aren't far-reaching, HOPEFULLY.)
    SessionList[SessionCount].Started = lpSessionDesc->dwUser1;

// NOTES: LOW-LEVEL NETWORKING IN RE-VOLT (CPrince ; Dec 2001)
//
// Here is the high-level protocol currently used during the connection phase:
// (1) SERVER: Create session.  (Listen for TCP connections, and respond to
//       UDP find-session requests.)
// (2) CLIENT: Find sessions, via broadcast UDP request.
// (3) CLIENT: Join session by making a TCP connection to the server.
// (4) CLIENT: Add players to the session by sending TCP requests to server.
// (5) SERVER: Respond to add-players requests via TCP.
// (6) BOTH:   <players send UDP packets to get ping times of all others>
// (7) SERVER: Start game.  (Send level name, final player list, etc to all
//       players, via TCP.)
//
// Basically we use UDP for session-discovery and ping-times, and TCP for all
// other connection setup.  (But we use UDP for in-game messages.)  Using TCP
// during setup is convenient because it gives us things like guaranteed and
// in-order delivery.  We bind UDP sockets to a port on all machines (because
// these sockets get used for peer-to-peer broadcast messaging, etc), but we
// only bind TCP sockets to a port on the server.
// $REVISIT: IS THE STATEMENT ABOUT BINDING STILL TRUE?  I DON'T THINK SO.
//
// Note that we might have multiple players on a single machine.  As a result,
// we track players and machines separately.  Sending a message to every
// player might result in unnecessary overhead, because we only need to send
// each message to each *machine* one time.



//$CMP_NOTE: Should we move all the low-level protocol stuff (eg, filling message header and bodies, and processing it) into separate file ??
/// (This would hide the complexity of that stuff, similar to how DPlay hid that part.  But not clear that we want to hide that stuff.)
/// (Maybe better would be to make send/receive funcs, to hide that complexity.  EG: SendJoinRequest() / RecvJoinRequest(), and other code just calls these guys.)

//$CMP_NOTE: we're currently giving each player a PlayerID.  Once the game
/// starts, we only use this for determining which player struct to update
/// when we receive a MSG_CAR_DATA.  Other than that, the original
/// codebase only used PlayerID as follows: (a) game code used it DURING
/// session-init, and (b) DPlay used it when indicating a removed player.
/// So we might not need the PlayerID once the game starts, and instead we
/// could just use the player's index in PlayerList, which will be the same
/// on all machines.  Just a thought.

//$CMP_NOTE:  Random thought: if the Xbox net connection is secure,
/// does that mean it's safe to use more client-side logic, as opposed to
/// an authoritative server model?  Though there are still some things you
/// might need to coordinate (eg, car-to-car collisions, two players
/// picking up same object, etc).  But you might be able to use clever
/// game design to work around some of these contention issues.
